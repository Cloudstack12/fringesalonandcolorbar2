                    Finding a salon that you can trust with your hair can be difficult. Personally, I have been through the process several times, and it always goes something like this: First, you get a recommendation from a friend, only to find that the stylist they recommended has gone to work elsewhere. You make an appointment anyway, but you aren’t satisfied with the result – so you have to start all over again!
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The good news is that, if you are a Houstonian (Houstonite? Houstoner?), the choice is clear. Not only has Fringe Color Bar & Salon been voted “best salon in Houston” two years in a row, but they are now able to provide you with the highest-quality hair extensions on top of their other services.

                    As part of its service menu expansion, the salon is offering hair extensions that, through the use of new techniques, can provide you with a more natural look while adding substantial length. These k-tip extensions are specifically designed to last longer without fraying or losing volume, and are among the most highly rated on the market
